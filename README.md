  - preprocess.py used to concatenate downloaded forecast database and compute model climatologies,
  - evaluation.ipynb used to restructure reanalysis data, compute evaluation metrics and plot results
  - linkages.ipynb used to compute correlations between variables of interest and QSW (or QSW forecast skill); and plot results
  - FDR.ipynb used to apply FDR correction to statistical significance (p-values) of of all correlations performed
